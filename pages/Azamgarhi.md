## About the Language

Azamgarhi is a unique Indo-Aryan language spoken exclusively by a significant Muslim population in the whole of Azamgarh and Mau districts and in the areas of Jaunpur district bordering the Azamgarh district in the Purvanchal region of the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. It falls in the Central zone of Indo-Aryan, further sub-categorized in the Eastern Hindi group, with Awadhi being its closest relative and also the base language. Azamgarhi is popularly called Musalmān Boli (the Muslim dialect/speech) as opposed to Hinduānā Boli (the Hindu dialect/speech), which is generally referenced to the Bhojpuri spoken in Azamgarh.

(Azamgarhi description in Urdu and Hindi is omitted from this conversion for brevity.)

## Azamgarhi Language Map

Here's a map illustrating the linguistic boundaries of Azamgarhi and its dialects. In the Azamgarhi dialect continuum, there are a number of local varieties spoken that considerably differ from each other.

## Documentation of Azamgarhi

The overall project is aimed at holistic and comprehensive documentation of the Azamgarhi language. The principal purpose of comprehensive documentation and research on this language along with archiving the documented materials is to attract attention and research on this not only understudied language but also a variety unknown to many in the linguistic academia.

## Fieldwork

Data was primarily elicited in the Azamgarh district of U.P. in two field trips, each being around three-week-long, and also from my relatives back at my hometown in the city of Mumbai.

## Archiving

The documented materials of the Azamgarhi language are archived at the ‘The Computational Resource for South Asian Languages’ (CoRSAL), a digital archive for minority languages of South Asia, part of the University of North Texas (UNT) Digital Library.

## Azamgarhi (SayMore-ELAN-) FLEx Project

Transcriptions, translations, and interlinear glossing of selected texts have been done. A FLEx project for the linguistic analyses of these files hosts more than a thousand lexical items in its corpus.

## About the Language

Azamgarhi is a unique Indo-Aryan language spoken exclusively by a significant Muslim population in the whole of Azamgarh (26°36'00" N, 83°11'24" E) and Mau (25°56'30" N, 83°33'40" E) districts and in the areas of Jaunpur district (25°45' N, 82°45' E) bordering the Azamgarh district in the Purvanchal region of the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. It falls in the Central zone of Indo-Aryan, further sub-categorized in the Eastern Hindi group, with Awadhi being its closest relative and also the base language. For a detailed classification of Azamgarhi into the Indi-Aryan family, visit [this link](https://sites.google.com/view/maazshaikh/languages?authuser=0#h.p9i4xlmugxo1). Azamgarhi is popularly called Musalmān Boli (the Muslim dialect/ speech) as opposed to Hinduānā Boli (the Hindu dialect/ speech), which is generally referenced to the Bhojpuri spoken in Azamgarh. The influential Muslims of Azamgarh—who were members of the Darbār (court) of the Nawābs in the Kingdom of Oudh or Awadh state that lasted for more than a couple of hundreds of years—brought the then prestigious Awadhi language to Azamgarh where Bhojpuri is the vernacular. The language soon became popular and spread among the zamīndār (landholding) Muslims and from them to other (lower) class Muslims residing in the villages dominated by the zamīndār Muslims. The Muslims of the villages of Azamgarh, which are not populated by these zamīndār Muslims, speak Bhojpuri as their mother tongue like the rest of the population. Bhojpuri is the region's vernacular as well as the substrate language. At the same time, Urdu is the superstrate with very high socio-religious prestige attached to it in the highly diglossic Azamgarhi speech community. Due to influences from these two languages, in the time period of more than hundreds of years, Azamgarhi has diverged from its parent language Awadhi to such an extent that one can observe it to be linguistically distinct from the Awadhi of Awadh region. The native speakers of Azamgarhi do not associate their language with the parent language Awadhi and consider their speech to be different from Bhojpuri as well. This language is an interesting survival of the influence of the former Muhammadan Awadh Court of Lucknow.

## Azamgarhi Language Map

Here's a map illustrating the linguistic boundaries of Azamgarhi and its dialects. In the Azamgarhi dialect continuum, there are a number of local varieties spoken that considerably differ from each other. Broadly, these can be tentatively grouped into three dialects or dialect groups, viz. Southern, Northern, and Eastern. Note that with further linguistic survey and research, if the Jolaha Boli is to be grouped under Azamgarhi, many more possible dialects are expected to come up in the future. However, the Southern dialect of Azamgarhi is unanimously considered the standard dialect by the Azamgarhi speech community. In the given map, the area colored in light orange is the Southern Azamgarhi dialect area, whereas the same in green is the dialect area of Northern Azamgarhi and in purple is the Eastern Azamgarhi dialect area.

## Documentation of Azamgarhi

The overall project is aimed at holistic and comprehensive documentation of the Azamgarhi language. The principal purpose of comprehensive documentation and research on this language along with archiving the documented materials is to attract attention and research on this not only understudied language but also a variety unknown to many in the linguistic academia.

### Fieldwork

Data was primarily elicited in the Azamgarh district of U.P. in two field trips, each being around three-week-long, in the month of January and February 2020, and November 2020; and also from my relatives back at my hometown in the city of Mumbai in December 2019 and further in July-Aug 2020. A couple of more fieldworks are anticipated in the coming time.

I am a semi-speaker of the Azamgarhi language, while my mother tongue is Urdu, and I am a member of the community.

### Archiving

The documented materials of the Azamgarhi language are archived at the ‘The Computational Resource for South Asian Languages’ (CoRSAL), a digital archive for minority languages of South Asia, part of the University of North Texas (UNT) Digital Library. Currently, the Azamgarhi collection includes audio and video recordings of texts; transcriptions, translations, interlinear glossing, and analyses of selected texts; digitized copies of fieldwork notes and photographs documenting fieldwork and other events. The texts are in different genres, such as traditional and children's stories, popular legends, historical accounts, personal narratives, natural conversations, dramas, folk songs, poems, food recipes, discussions on events or items of cultural importance, and discussions on language and linguistic data. Some of them are also in the Bhojpuri language given with a view of (socio)linguistic comparison, whereas some are the outcomes of dialect surveys undertaken to determine the extent of Azamgarhi. The majority of materials were collected starting from late 2019 while working on my Master of Philosophy dissertation at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. I will be adding interlinear glossing and analyses of selected texts to the collection shortly. I've ensured that at least the description of the language and titles of every item have Urdu and Hindi translation. I would love to provide descriptions and other things in them as well, but I was constrained by a lack of time.

To access the documented Azamgarhi language materials, please visit the [Azamgarhi Language Resources](https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/AZLR/) of the CoRSAL Archive.

### Azamgarhi (SayMore-ELAN-) FLEx Project

Transcriptions, translations, and interlinear glossing of a couple of selected texts too have been done so far. I have created a FLEx project for the linguistic analyses of these files, which currently hosts more than a thousand lexical items in its corpus. SayMore is being used for transcribing the recordings and translating them into English and Hindi-Urdu. These files are later exported to FLEx for interlinearization and glossing and then imported into ELAN.

## Language Revitalization

### A special presentation of documented Azamgarhi traditional stories on YouTube

My YouTube channel's '[Children's stories in Azamgarhi language](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRt2XC79sI4atObD-mM59oLaNaZPVBcSO)' playlist hosts edited recordings of traditional stories collected in the Azamgarhi language during my fieldwork in the Azamgarh region. The recordings are edited and presented in a video format made of relevant (downloaded) cartoon images synced with the audio. Though these videos are basically targeted at children, they are also made, bearing in mind that Azamgarhi has quite a large number of semi and L2 speakers. Presentation in this format also makes the audio look catchy and appeasing even to elders. Also, this method seems the most feasible and accommodating way to initiate language revitalization, even though the initiative is on quite a small level. Some of the recordings are yet to be edited and uploaded on YouTube, which will be done in the weeks to come. I thank everyone involved in this.
