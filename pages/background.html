        <h1>My Background</h1>

        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>I was born and brought up in Mumbai, India. My ancestral family hails from the Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh. I did my schooling at <a href="https://stdominicsavio.com/">St. Dominic Savio High School</a> and my Intermediate Education (10+2) at <a href="https://mithibai.ac.in/">Mithibai College</a>, Mumbai. I have a BE in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.djsce.ac.in/">Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering</a>, Mumbai.</p>

        <h2>Passion for Languages</h2>
        <p>During my undergraduate days, I developed a strong affinity and passion for languages, focusing on my mother tongue Urdu, or more generally, Hindustani. This led me to the field of 'Linguistics' or 'Language Science'.</p>

        <h2>Master's Program in Linguistics</h2>
        <p>After completing my undergrad degree, I joined the Master's program in Linguistics at the <a href="http://du.ac.in/">University of Delhi</a> (DU), Delhi. Here, I was trained by notable linguists and educators, including <a href="http://oldweb.du.ac.in/uploads/Faculty%20Profiles/Linguistic/Gail_Coelho_Linguistics.pdf">Dr. Gail Coelho</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tista_Bagchi">Prof. Tista Bagchi</a>, and others. My focus was on lesser-explored languages and language documentation.</p>

        <h2>Research and Fieldwork</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Documenting the Ladakhi language with consultants Jigmet Dorje and Nilza Angmo, culminating in my MA thesis titled 'Interrogation in Ladakhi'.</li>
            <li>Exploring Western Tibetic languages, leading to my choice of Balti for further research.</li>
            <li>Working on Eastern Purik and Sham Ladakhi during my M. Phil. program at <a href="https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> under <a href="https://jnu.ac.in/content/pkdas">Prof. Pradeep Kumar Das</a>.</li>
            <li>Documenting my heritage language, Azamgarhi, and conducting dialect surveys on Bhojpuri.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Pursuits and Doctoral Research</h2>
        <p>I am currently writing my M. Phil. thesis, titled 'Verb Morphology in Awadhi of Azamgarh', and pursuing doctoral research on Zangskari, a Western Tibetic language.</p>
