# Azamgarhi

## About the Language

Azamgarhi is a unique Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Purvanchal region of Uttar Pradesh, India. It's closely related to Awadhi and is known locally as Musalmān Boli, contrasting with the Bhojpuri-speaking Hindu population. Influenced by Urdu and Bhojpuri, Azamgarhi has evolved significantly from Awadhi. For a detailed classification, visit [this link](/research).

- **Location**: Spoken in Azamgarh, Mau, and parts of Jaunpur district.
- **Dialects**: Southern (Dakkhin wālī bōlī), Northern (Uttar wālī bōlī), and Eastern (Pūrab wālī bōlī).
- **Recognition**: Identified by Glottolog code azam1235 but lacks official recognition in India.
- **Current Status**: Under pressure from Urdu, Hindi, and English, and not widely passed to younger generations.

## M.Phil. Thesis on Azamgarhi Verb Morphology

This study, titled ["Verb Morphology in Awadhi of Azamgarh"](https://zenodo.org/record/5704835){:target="_blank"}, is the first detailed description of the (finite) verb morphology in Azamgarhi. Conducted as part of my M.Phil. thesis at Jawaharlal Nehru University, it explores the derivation and inflection in Azamgarhi verbal morphology, based on analysis from the Southern dialect. The research provides a comprehensive structural and functional account of theme formation in Eastern Hindi languages, with a focus on realis–irrealis modal concepts in Azamgarhi.
