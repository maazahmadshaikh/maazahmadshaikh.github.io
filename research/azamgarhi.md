## About the language

Azamgarhi is an underdescribed **Indo-Aryan (Eastern Hindi / Awadhic)** language spoken in the Purvanchal region of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is closely related to Awadhi and has developed under sustained contact with **Urdu** and **Bhojpuri**, resulting in distinctive phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical patterns. Within the local sociolinguistic ecology, Azamgarhi is often referred to as *Musalmān bolī*, in contrast to neighbouring Bhojpuri-speaking Hindu communities.

Despite its widespread everyday use in parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Azamgarhi lacks official recognition and remains largely absent from formal education and institutional domains.

- **Location**: Primarily spoken in Azamgarh and Mau districts, with extensions into parts of Jaunpur district  
- **Dialectal variation**: Southern (*Dakkhin wālī bolī*), Northern (*Uttar wālī bolī*), and Eastern (*Pūrab wālī bolī*) varieties  
- **Classification**: Awadhic (Eastern Hindi); listed in Glottolog (azam1235)  
- **Sociolinguistic status**: Under increasing pressure from Standard Hindi, Urdu, and English, with reduced intergenerational transmission in many contexts

## Documentation of Azamgarhi

My work on Azamgarhi focuses on **language documentation and description**, with particular attention to morphosyntax and verbal morphology. The project aims to create a durable, accessible documentary record of the language based on naturalistic data.

All materials are archived with the **Computational Resource for South Asian Languages (CoRSAL)** at the University of North Texas Digital Library.  
The collection can be accessed here:  
[Azamgarhi Language Resources (CoRSAL)](https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/AZLR/){:target="_blank"}

### Fieldwork

Primary data were collected in Azamgarh district, supplemented by recordings with speakers residing in Mumbai. As a heritage speaker with long-term community ties, I combine insider knowledge with standard documentary and analytical methods. While the existing corpus dates mainly from late 2019 onwards, further documentation remains a long-term goal.

### Archiving and genres

The archived collection includes multiple genres, such as narratives, conversations, and elicited materials. Descriptive metadata and annotations are provided in **Urdu and Hindi** where possible, in line with community preferences and accessibility.

## Community-oriented activities

Alongside academic documentation, I engage in modest community-facing activities aimed at increasing awareness and accessibility of Azamgarhi, especially for younger speakers and learners. These include curated storytelling materials and informal dissemination of language-related content through online platforms. These efforts are intended as supplementary outreach rather than as primary documentation outputs.

## M.Phil. thesis on Azamgarhi verb morphology

My M.Phil. thesis,  
**_Verb morphology in Awadhi of Azamgarh_**,  
completed at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, is the first detailed grammatical study devoted specifically to Azamgarhi verbal morphology.

The study provides a systematic analysis of derivational and inflectional morphology in the finite verb, based primarily on data from the Southern variety. Particular attention is paid to **theme formation**, **aspect–mood interactions**, and the role of **realis–irrealis distinctions** within the broader Eastern Hindi context.
