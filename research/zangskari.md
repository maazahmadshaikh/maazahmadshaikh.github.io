## Varieties and dialects

For practical documentary purposes, I work with the following broad regional groupings, which align well with local usage:

- **Upper Zangskari (Stod)** — associated with the Stod / Doda river corridor  
- **Central Zangskari (Zhung / Zhungkor)** — centered around the Padum plain  
- **Lower Zangskari (Sham)** — downstream stretches of the Zangskar river  
- **Lungnak (Lungna[k])** — the Lungnak valley region  
- **Paldar (Kishtwar)** — treated here as part of the wider Zangskari continuum based on linguistic similarity and speaker self-identification  

Notes:

- Variation is not confined to regional boundaries
- Intra-village and intra-family variation is common
- These labels are best understood as **working groupings**, not rigid divisions

## Naming and label choice

- Multiple names are used for the language across communities and scholarly traditions
- On this website, I consistently use **Zangskari** as the English label
- This choice balances local recognition with clarity for academic reference and indexing
