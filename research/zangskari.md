## Where Zangskari is spoken

- **Main concentration:** villages across the Zangskar Valley in today’s **Kargil district (UT Ladakh)** :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Additional areas:**  
  - **Rangdum** (often treated as part of the wider Zangskar-speaking region in regional descriptions) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
  - **Paldar (Kishtwar):** a Tibetic-speaking community whose variety patterns very closely with core Zangskari in my recent interactions (see “Varieties and dialects” below) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Administrative context (why this matters for language)

- Zangskar is currently treated as a subdivision within **Kargil district**, with local governance organized through units such as tehsils/blocks/panchayats (terminology varies by administrative source). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Recent policy announcements indicate a plan for **Zangskar to become a district by 2028**, alongside other proposed districts in Ladakh. If implemented, this could affect schooling, cultural programming, and other domains that shape language use. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Varieties and dialects

A practical working division used in my write-up (and broadly consistent with community-oriented grouping) includes:

- **Upper Zangskari (Stod)** — associated with the Stod/Doda river corridor :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- **Central Zangskari (Zhung/Zhungkor)** — centered around the Padum plain area :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Lower Zangskari (Sham)** — downstream stretches of the Zangskar river :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Lungnak (Lungna[k])** — the Lungnak/Lungna region :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- **Paldar (Kishtwar) as an additional variety:** based on my 2025 interactions with multiple speakers and their own self-identification, I treat the Tibetic variety of Paldar as part of the Zangskari dialect continuum. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  

Notes I keep in mind when writing about “dialects” here:

- Variation is not only between regions; it can also be noticeable **within** the same village (and even within families), so these labels are best treated as **convenient groupings**, not hard boundaries. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

## Naming and label choice

- Zangskari is referred to by multiple names across communities and scholarly traditions.  
- On this website, I use **“Zangskari”** as my consistent English label because it aligns well with local recognition while also being clear for academic indexing and cross-referencing. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

## My work on Zangskari (documentation and analysis)

- **Doctoral research focus:** documentary description of Zangskari (with a strong emphasis on phonetics/phonology within a broader grammatical description). :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- **Fieldwork timeline (Zangskar):**
  - Pilot: **Sep–Oct 2020**
  - Major trips: **Jul–Aug 2022**, **Jul–Aug 2023**
  - Most recent: **Jun–Aug 2025** :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- **Archiving:** Zangskari materials are deposited with **CoRSAL** (University of North Texas). :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  
- **Current linked projects (high level):**
  - **Epic of Gesar (Zangskari version):** annotated audiovisual corpus + multilingual subtitles; experimentation with AI-supported visual materials for broader access :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  
  - **Dissertation corpus:** documentary dataset used for phonological and grammatical analysis :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}  
  - **Language context manuscript:** historical/social setting for interpretation of language practices and transmission :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

## Why the “outdated” parts matter (and what I now emphasize)

When I update this page, I try to keep the emphasis on factors that directly relate to documentation and transmission:

- **Mobility and education:** schooling outside the valley, long stays away from family, and contact with regional lingua francas can affect proficiency and everyday use (domain shift). :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}  
- **Administration and infrastructure:** changes in governance and connectivity can reshape which languages get used in school, public services, and work. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}
